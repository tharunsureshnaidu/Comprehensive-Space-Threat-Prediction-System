The **Comprehensive Space Threat Assessment and Prediction System (CSTAPS)** is a web-based application designed to analyze and predict potential threats from Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). It integrates NASA's NEO API with advanced machine learning models and physics-based simulations to provide real-time data analysis, interactive visualizations, and impact predictions.

## Installation
To run the CSTAPS project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Space-Threat-Assessment-System.git
   cd Space-Threat-Assessment-System
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage
1. **📡 Real-Time Data Analysis**:
   - The application fetches real-time data from NASA's NEO API and displays it in an interactive dashboard.

2. **📈 Threat Prediction**:
   - Use the machine learning models to predict the probability of NEO impacts.

3. **💥 Impact Simulation**:
   - Simulate the effects of NEO collisions, including crater formation and atmospheric effects.

4. **📤 Data Export**:
   - Export data and visualizations in CSV, JSON, or Excel formats.
